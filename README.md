# ECSE 415

ECSE 415 or Introduction to Computer Vision course is an introduction to the automated processing, analysis, and understanding of image data. In this course, students are given an overview of designing and programming in Python and OpenCV in the context of solving practical problems in the field of computer vision.

There are a total of four individual assignments and one final group project.

# Assignment 2
Tasks:
* Invariance of SIFT Features
  * Invariance Under Changes in Scale
  * Invariance under Rotation
